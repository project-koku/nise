## About

A tool for generating sample cost and usage data for testing purposes.

To submit an issue please visit https://issues.redhat.com/projects/COST/.

## Getting Started

This is a Python project developed using Python 3.11. Make sure you have at least this version installed.

### Development

To get started developing against Nise first clone a local copy of the git repository.

    git clone https://github.com/project-koku/nise

Developing inside a virtual environment is recommended. This project utilizes [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/). By default, `uv` creates a virtual env and installs the project in editable-mode. To run `nise` using the virtual env, use `uv`:

    uv run nise -h

To build the command line tool run

    uv build

For generating sample data for developing or testing Koku, please refer to [Ingesting Nise data with Koku](docs/working_with_masu.md).

#### Updating packages

All packages (including dev) can be updated with:

    uv sync --upgrade --all-groups

or

    make upgrade-requirements

#### Testing

Nise uses tox to standardize the environment used when running tests. Install `tox-uv` ([docs]https://github.com/tox-dev/tox-uv):

    uv tool install tox --with tox-uv # use uv to install

tox manages its own virtual environment and a copy of required dependencies to run tests. To ensure a clean tox environment run

    tox -r

This will rebuild the tox virtual env and then run all tests.

The test env does not need to be rebuilt every time unit tests are run. To run all unit tests without rebuild:

    tox

To run unit tests from a single file, e.g.:

    tox -- tests.test_aws_generator

To run a specific test from a specific file, e.g.:

    make test test_source=<aws|azure|gcp|ocp>


#### Linting

This repository uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) to check and enforce code style. It uses [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) to format and lint the Python code. Other formats and text files are linted as well.

To run pre-commit checks:

    pre-commit run --all-files

or:

    make lint


#### Publishing

Publishing is achieved by merging a new version into `main`. Increment the version in [nise/__init__.py]. This can be done via `hatch`. For example, to bump the version to `4.9.9`, one would do:

    $ uv run hatch version 4.9.9
    Old: 4.7.0
    New: 4.9.9

Add the version change in `nise/__init__.py` to your PR and ask for a review. As soon as your PR is merged to main, a new koku-nise package will built, tagged, and deployed to PyPI.

##### Finer Publishing Details

All of the deployment is driven entirely by a Github Action workflow, so if issues ever crop up, start in `publish-to-pypi.yml`. When a branch is merged into main, the Action will kick off. There are three things that must happen before a deployment is successful, a successful artifact build, and the tag must not yet exist in git. After the artifact is published, it\'ll be available at [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/koku-nise/#history).

### Notes

1.  If `--aws-s3-report-name` or `--aws-s3-report-prefix` are specified
    they should match what is configured in the AWS cost usage report
    settings.
1.  For `--aws-finalize`:
    -   `copy` will create a local copy of the data with a `-finalized`
        suffix and invoice id populated.
    -   `overwrite` will generate a regular report with the invoice id
        populated.
1.  If `--insights-upload` is specified and pointing to a URL endpoint,
    you must have `HCC_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID` and `HCC_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_SECRET` set in your
    environment. Payloads for insights uploads will be split on a
    per-file basis.
1.  If `--static-report-file` is used start_date will default to first
    day of current month. `start_date: last_month` will be first day of
    previous month. `start_date: today` will start at the first hour of
    current day. `end_date` can support relative days from the
    `start_date`. i.e `end_date: 2` is two days after start date.
1.  `--static-report-file` usage dates has a special `full_period` key
    value which will specify a usage for the entire
    `start_date - end_date` range.
1.  `--ros-ocp-info` when we generate ros data along with this parameter
    then we will be getting ros-ocp metrix too.
