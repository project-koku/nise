## About

A tool for generating sample cost and usage data for testing purposes.

To submit an issue please visit https://issues.redhat.com/projects/COST/.

## Getting Started

This is a Python project developed using Python 3.11. Make sure you have at least this version installed.

### Development

To get started developing against Nise first clone a local copy of the git repository.

    git clone https://github.com/project-koku/nise

Developing inside a virtual environment is recommended. A Pipfile is provided. Pipenv is recommended for combining virtual environment (virtualenv) and dependency management (pip). To install pipenv, use pip

    pip3 install pipenv

Then project dependencies and a virtual environment can be created using

    pipenv install --dev

To activate the virtual environment run

    pipenv shell

To build the command line tool run

    python setup.py install

For generating sample data for developing or testing Koku, please refer to [Ingesting Nise data with Koku](docs/working_with_masu.md).

#### Testing

Nise uses tox to standardize the environment used when running tests. Essentially, tox manages its own virtual environment and a copy of required dependencies to run tests. To ensure a clean tox environment run

    tox -r

This will rebuild the tox virtual env and then run all tests.

To run sanity tests

    tox -e sanity

To run all unit tests specifically:

    make test

To run unit tests for a single provider:

    make test test_source=<aws|azure|gcp|ocp|oci>


#### Linting

This repository uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) to check and enforce code style. It uses [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) to reformat the Python code and [Flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org) to check it afterwards. Other formats and text files are linted as well.

To run pre-commit checks:

    pre-commit run --all-files


#### Publishing

Please remember to sync your updated dependecies to setup.py with :

    pipenv-setup sync -p

After that, make sure to increment the version in setup.py. As soon as your PR is merged to main, a new koku-nise package will built, tagged, and deployed to PyPI.

##### Finer Publishing Details

All of the deployment is driven entirely by a Github Action workflow, so if issues ever crop up, start in `publish-to-pypi.yml`. When a branch is merged into main, the Action will kick off. There are three things that must happen before a deployment is successful, a successful artifact build, dependencies verified in sync between the requirements files, and setup.py, and the tag must not yet exist in git. The dependency syncing/verification is done with the [pipenv-setup](https://github.com/Madoshakalaka/pipenv-setup) tool. After the artifact is deployed, it\'ll be available at [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/koku-nise/#history).

#### Nise, Koku, and IQE Integration

The iqe tests use nise to generate mock data; therefore, we need to ensure that our nise changes do not break the iqe tests. To do this you will need to copy `.env.example` to `.env` and customize as necessary. After the `.env` file is configured you will then need to run

    make run-iqe

The `make run-iqe` command by default will run the smoke tests. However, if you want to run a specific iqe test command you can pass it in through the `IQE_CMD` parameter

    make run-iqe IQE_CMD='iqe tests plugin hccm -k test_api_aws_provider_create_foo_resource_name'

### Prereqs

- AWS population requires prior setup of AWS Cost and Usage Report of same name to be created, as well as associated Bucket, Policy, Role, etc.

### Notes

1.  If `--aws-s3-report-name` or `--aws-s3-report-prefix` are specified
    they should match what is configured in the AWS cost usage report
    settings.
1.  For `--aws-finalize`:
    -   `copy` will create a local copy of the data with a `-finalized`
        suffix and invoice id populated.
    -   `overwrite` will generate a regular report with the invoice id
        populated.
1.  If `--insights-upload` is specified and pointing to a URL endpoint,
    you must have `HCC_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID` and `HCC_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_SECRET` set in your
    environment. Payloads for insights uploads will be split on a
    per-file basis.
1.  If `--static-report-file` is used start_date will default to first
    day of current month. `start_date: last_month` will be first day of
    previous month. `start_date: today` will start at the first hour of
    current day. `end_date` can support relative days from the
    `start_date`. i.e `end_date: 2` is two days after start date.
1.  `--static-report-file` usage dates has a special `full_period` key
    value which will specify a usage for the entire
    `start_date - end_date` range.
1.  `--ros-ocp-info` when we generate ros data along with this parameter
    then we will be getting ros-ocp metrix too.
